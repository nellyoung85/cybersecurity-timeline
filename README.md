The evolution of cybersecurity, timeline
•	Early Era (1940s-1960s):
•	1940s: Early computer systems developed, with security concerns primarily focused on physical access control and data protection within closed systems. 
•	1950s: The concept of "phone phreaking" emerges, where individuals exploit vulnerabilities in telephone systems, laying the groundwork for future cybercrime. 
•	1960s: The development of the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, begins, with initial security considerations around network access control. 
•	The ARPANET Era (1970s): This period played a major roll in the evolution of cybersecurity. The first computer virus "Creeper" worm was created by Bob Thomson in 1971. It was considered as one of the first known malware programs though harmless it highlighted the potential for malicious activity on networks. **1972**: Ray Tomlinson creates the first email program on ARPANET, leading to the rise of electronic communication and the potential for email-based cyber threats. Mid 70s The concept of "password protection" started to be implemented on early computer systems. 1970s is the year of the birth of networking and the first cyber threat.lessons  learnt in this era is the knowledge that networks and data breaches can happen and preparation to fight it began.


1980s.
•	Mid-1980s: The "Morris Worm created by morries  in 1982 infects a significant portion of the internet, demonstrating the potential damage of wide spread malware. 1983: The term "cyber security" is coined by computer scientist Robert Barnard.  The first known anti-virus program  called Elk coner was created to combat viruses  by Rich skrenta. In 1987 john MacAfee introduced the  first commercial  anti-virus software. Designed to scan and remove viruses in computers.
The Internet Boom (1990s):created. what we lernt.
 The 1980s taught us that with the spread of computers, cybersecurity had to evolve quickly to curtail criminality and protect data from getting into wrong hands.


Early 1990s: The World Wide Web gains widespread adoption, leading to a surge in online activity and potential cyber threats.  Phishing and social engineering became dominant: Mid-1990s: The "Hacker Ethic" is debated, with discussions about the ethical boundaries of computer hacking.  1995: concept of a firewall for internet security becomes widely adopted as a standard measure to protect network. firewall technology becomes more prevalent, used to control network traffic and protect systems from unauthorized access. 1998: The first Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is recorded, targeting the University of Minnesota. 1998 establishment of CERT(computer emergency response team) to coordinate response to cyber incident.
Lessons from the 1990s
The threats of the early days of the internet through the 1990s highlight the critical need for ongoing cybersecurity training for all of your staff – including interns and volunteers. Implementing training can significantly reduce your vulnerability to cyber attack.


Early 2000s: The rise of sophisticated cybercrime, including identity theft, phishing scams, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  (THE I LOVE YOU) worm , emergence of botnets and data breachesMid-2000s: Increased focus on data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Late 2000s - Present: Emergence of advanced threats like ransom ware, zero-day exploits, and targeted attacks, leading to a greater emphasis on proactive threat intelligence and incident aresponse.  Government began to implement stricter regulations. We now see( APTS)ADVANCED PERSISTENCE THREATS. HIGH TARGET AND SOPHISTICATED  CYBERATTACKS AIMED AT GOVERNMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS.2000 the focus has shifted from antivirus and fire walls to a more comprehensive approach, more focus on network security, user education, and data protection. Present Day: Focus on cyber security awareness training, cloud security, and the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for threat detection and mitigation. Key points to remember: The evolution of cyber security has largely mirrored the development of computer technology, with new threats emerging alongside new capabilities. The shift from primarily physical security concerns to network-based threats was a major turning point in cyber security history. Also artificial intelligence techniques has been used to enhance the security of our networks and computers, it can analyse network traffic, user behaviour that  evads  traditional  method. Ai can analyse  malware samples,incident response automation, vunerability assessment.
Looking back over the past 20 years, we see a period defined by evolving cyber threats. The early 2000s saw the rise of the internet and the dawn of e-commerce, which brought unprecedented opportunities alongside new security challenges. As technology evolved, so did the sophistication of cyber attacks. The threat landscape has continually shifted from simple viruses and malware to complex ransomware and state-sponsored hacking, necessitating a proactive and informed approach to cybersecurity.
